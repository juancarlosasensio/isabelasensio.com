                  We got you a domain! The possibilities are endless...
                </p>
                <p>
                  For one year, <strong>isabelasensio.com</strong> is all yours, sponsored by yours truly. 
                  If you want to connect it to Squarespace or Shopify, you'll first need to create an account on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> using your email.
                  Juanca will then transfer ownership of your domain over to you.
                </p>
                <p>After one year, you will have to renew your purchase to continue owning your domain.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>But, wait...there's more!</strong> From today until your next birthday,
                  you'll have the option to "hire" Juanca, free of charge, and collaborate in building
                  your fully-customized portfolio website.

  <h4>whaaat?</h4>
  <p>
    We got you a domain! And the possibilities are endless...
  </p>
  <h4>...meaning?</h4>
  <p>
    For one year, <strong> <a href="isabelasensio.com">isabelasensio.com</a></strong> is all yours!
    You can do anything you want with it, like publishing a Squarespace or Shopify site. 
  </p>
  <h4>what's the catch?</h4>
  <p>
    To start managing your domain, create an account on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Namecheap</strong></a>.
    Juanca will then transfer ownership of your domain over to you.
  </p>
  <p>After one year, you will have to renew your purchase to continue owning your domain.</p>
  <h4>but, wait...there's more!</h4>
  <p>
    From today until your next birthday,
    you'll have the option to "hire" Juanca, free of charge, to build
    your fully-customized portfolio website.
